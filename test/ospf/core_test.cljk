  "Round-trip and negative-path tests for the OSPFv2 wire codec.

  Vectors cited to a section/appendix number are RFC 2328 or RFC 1071
  text, quoted or transcribed verbatim in the namespace docstring next to
  the code that uses them. Vectors marked `;; constructed, not a
  published spec vector` are hand-built here — the RFCs describe the
  fixed-layout header, five packet bodies and the LSA header in prose and
  ASCII diagrams, not with worked full-packet byte dumps the way the
  Modbus Application Protocol Specification's §6 does, so most framing
  vectors in this suite are constructed against the diagrams rather than
  lifted from a published byte dump. What *is* a published worked
  example — because RFC 1071 §3 gives one — is the checksum test below,
  and it is cited exactly."
