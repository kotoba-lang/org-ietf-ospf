  "Big-endian byte packing for the fixed-width integer fields OSPF packets
  are built from: 8-bit octets, 16-bit fields (Packet length, Checksum,
  AuType, HelloInterval, LS age, ...), and 32-bit fields (Router ID, Area
  ID, Network Mask, LS sequence number, ...). All OSPF fields are
  big-endian (RFC 2328 Appendix A.3.1 diagrams read most-significant-octet
  first, the standard Internet wire order).

  Every function here takes/returns plain integers and vectors of ints
  0..255 — no `byte` type, no signed-byte wraparound. Sequences are
  `Sequential` collections of ints in 0..255, in and out, matching the
  convention `kotoba-lang/org-modbus` uses."

;; ── 32-bit fields ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
;;
;; The top byte of a 32-bit field cannot go through `bit-shift-left` /
;; `bit-or` the way the 16-bit helpers above do. ClojureScript's bitwise
;; operators coerce both operands through JavaScript's ToInt32 first, so
;; `(bit-shift-left 0xC0 24)` — needed the instant the top byte is >= 0x80,
;; which for a Router ID or Area ID is any address from 128.0.0.0 upward —
;; produces a *negative* Int32 (its two's-complement reading), and a
;; subsequent `bit-or` with the lower bytes silently keeps that sign flip
;; instead of raising it. The JVM's `bit-shift-left` has no such ceiling
;; (Clojure longs are 64-bit), so this would round-trip clean on `clj -M`
;; and only break under `nbb`/ClojureScript — exactly the kind of
;; platform-only bug this workspace's `.cljc` discipline exists to catch
;; before it ships (see `modbus.crc`'s own note on `(map int str)` for the
;; same class of JVM/JS divergence).
;;
;; `quot`/multiplication have no 32-bit ceiling on either platform — both
;; keep exact integers well past 2**32 — so the 32-bit helpers use those
;; instead of shifting across the sign boundary, and `bit-and 0xFF` (safe:
;; its operand is always < 256, nowhere near the Int32 boundary) to cut
;; each byte out.

;; RFC 2328 §12.1.6: "The sequence number field is a signed 32-bit integer

;; i.e. it is the smallest (most negative) representable value plus one,
;; not a large positive number. Decoding the wire pattern as an unsigned
;; integer and comparing unsigned would put InitialSequenceNumber (a fresh
;; LSA's very first instance) *above* MaxSequenceNumber (0x7fffffff, the
;; last instance before an LSA must be flushed and re-originated) instead
;; of below it, inverting the newer/older comparison built on top.
